I am a competitive thinker with an emphasis on thorough research in order to develop a variety of solutions for a given problem. This skill has led me to develop a talent for writing with detailed problem analysis. I have a high aptitude for math and computer programming, and pursued these interests through independent study in addition to formal education and training. I currently have experiences in working with the following programming languages and frameworks:

*  Ruby and Rails
*  HTML and CSS
*  jQuery and Javascript
*  Bootstrap and Semantic-UI
*  PostgreSQL, SQLite and SQL
*  Visual Basic

These coding tools are a select few of what I have become familiar with, and will be seeking to obtain full mastery of in the years to come. Additionally I am keen on learning other development tools, especially in web design and front end frameworks, such as AngularJS and vector graphic software, as well as mobile application environments particularly for Android. I am looking for opportunities with idea generation and implementation of programming projects within a quality teamwork setting, as well as development of ethical values as related to internet use.
