  <h1>A Little Bit About Me and this Website</h1>

  <img src="./images/DylanMassellprofile.jpg" alt="Dylan_Massell_profile"></img>
  <p>Welcome to my personal space of the web. My name is Dylan Massell, and I like to see myself as a philosopher.
    And I mean that in the mere sense of a lover of knowledge. Learning is my passion, whether it's coding and programing,
    mathematics and science, psychology and theology, music and art, history and law, or business and economics. These are
    areas that I have had some education or experience in, and have a deep interest in further pursuits. I will be using this
    site to showcase my work, experiences, what I've learned in these areas, as well as life in general. I'd be very
    grateful for your feedback or any oppurtunities you'd like to share. Don't hesitate to get in touch,
    and I hope you find interest in my ideas!
  </p>
