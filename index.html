  <h1>A Little Bit About Me and this Website</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my personal little area of the web, my name is Dylan Massell, and I like to see myself as a philosopher.
    And I mean that in the mere sense of a lover of knowledge. Learning is my passion, whether it's coding and programing,
    mathematics and science, psychology and theology, music and art, history and law, or business and economics. These are
    areas that I have had some education or experience in, and have a deep interest in pursuing further. I will be using this
    site to showcase my work and experiences, and what I've learned in these areas as well as life in general. I'd be very
    grateful for your feedback as well as any oppurtunities you might feel I'd be interested in. Don't hesitate to get in touch,
    and I hope you might find some meaning in my ideas!
  </p>
