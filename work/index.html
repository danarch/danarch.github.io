<h3>Experience:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><h4>IT Consultant and Web Developer for Massell Commercial Real Estate (July 2017 - Present)</h4>

    <p>I developed and wrote from scrath a Wordpress static blog site for my father's own commercial real estate company.
    I also provide consulting on technology and data entry tasks when needed as well as document copywriting and editing.</p>
    </li>
  <li><h4>VIP Host for Live Nation across various local Venues (July 2016 - Present)</h4>

    <p>This part-time job has been incredibly rewarding and enjoyable, as I usher season ticket holders during concert
    and comedy shows into their Premium Seating. This involves welcoming our guests as they arrive, ensuring their seats
  are reserved for them exclusively, keeping the included amenities clean and proper, and upselling the program when possible.</p>
    </li>
  <li><h4>Technical Writer for Dynamic Data Services (October 2015 - December 2016)</h4>

    <p>In this position I created, formatted and organized documents from aggregated email threads into a Microsoft
      SharePoint site for our clients to allow for the archives to be searchable and interlinked. I documented this
    process and created simple email scripts to allow for this to be done in a semi automated and thus quicker fashion
     than doing every step manually.</p>
    </li>
  <li><h4>Portfolio Analyst for Indigo Payments (May 2013 – June 2014)</h4>

    <p>The core of this job was to act as an intermediary between company departments by maintaining the database of
      clients, and improving sales and customer retention with in depth data analysis. I helped develop systems to
      track customer case reporting, employee time management, as well as improving the UX of the internal desktop
      application, among other accomplishments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>University of St. Andrews Radio host and co-director (March 2011 - May 2012)</h4>

    <p>This opportunity involved planning the theme and music playlist for a weekly hour long internet radio show
      co-hosted with two other presenters. Aside from learning some of the technicalities of running a radio show,
      this experience required collaborative prioritization of ideas between the hosts, as well as developing
      empowerment for my voice.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Volunteer for Children’s Restoration Network (June – August 2011)</h4>

    <p>I coordinated and tracked time for a 343 hour long concert, a Guinness world record. This may sound a little
      taxing, but being able to support local independent artists while fundraising for a wonderful charity was one
      of my most fun and memorable experiences.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Summer Internship with Protocol Entertainment (June – August 2010)</h4>

    <p>My duties during this position involved networking and promoting the artists and their work through radio
      channels across the country. I helped gain exposure through event booking and radio airplay for the clients,
      while also serving as an administrative assistant for a one-person business in one of the toughest industries
      of the time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Summer Internship with Blind Ambition Management (June – August 2009)</h4>

    <p>Responsibilities for my first job were wide ranged, including reviewing legal contracts, social media marketing,
      coordinating artist tour itineraries, and scouting for new clients through demos and live shows. I also composed
      and edited a promotional video for an artist who would be nominated for a Grammy later that year.
