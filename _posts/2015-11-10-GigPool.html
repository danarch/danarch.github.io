excerpt: >
  Lead development and design of backend database for platform that would serve as common job application site for gig economy
  companies. The user would input basic information and the assets and talents they would be willing to use for work and jobs,
  receive a filtered list of companies for which they're qualified, of which they can choose those they wish to send their
  information and make an job application.

  During the Iron Yard's engineering bootcamp, we had an internal hack-a-thon to put the skills we had learned to the test.
  Each team consisted of a Rails developer, two front-end engineers and an iOS developer, and were then assigned one of three
  application ideas. My team were to develop an iOS game where a user would take a picture of a cloud, input what it looked
  like to them, and send it to their friends to have them guess what they saw. Players would earn points for guessing the
  same as their friends.
</p>
<p>
  I took charge of designing the backend database and overall function of the application, through setting up a Rails API to
  interact with the iOS application with JSON. Unfortunately, our iOS team member had to withdraw from the competition on the
  second day, so I had to convert everything back to a web based application. My two front end team members really stepped up
  in designing the views for the application, on top of their work on the logo and other design features.
