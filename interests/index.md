Aside from my philosophical reasoning and computer programming skills, I find joy and happiness in my life through hobbies like attending concerts, collecting and exploring music, video games, billiards, card and board games, cooking, science fiction, and stay active with fencing, hiking and camping. I also enjoy travelling, especially international opportunities, exploring art galleries and museums, and meeting new people to learn their stories and perspectives. This area is dedicated to showcase my experiences with these interests.
