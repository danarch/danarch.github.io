  <p class="text-justify">Studying philosophy and mathematics at an international university, analyzing company sales numbers and customer
    service cases through programming, and learning Ruby on Rails web development have made me into a uniquely talented
    worker. I can leverage big picture, global thinking with a focus on the details into web services that can truly
    make an impact. I am most passionate about consciousness and language, and how to efficiently and effectively bring
    people together for a better world.
