I have always had a love for knowledge, and with this site brings the opportunity to share what I've learned
and my ideas on various issues. This is a truly amazing time to be alive, as we are slowly witnessing the development of a cooperative gloabal civilization. These are some blog posts and articles dealing with my philosophy and perspective on life, the universe, and everything.
